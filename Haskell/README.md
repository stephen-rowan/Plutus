## Haskell Installation

https://www.haskell.org/platform/linux.html#linux-ubuntu

 sudo apt-get install haskell-platform

## Version Issue ?

I have installed the haskell-platform that haskell.org recommends on ubuntu (e.g., sudo apt-get install haskell-platform) - I checked the ghc version (ghc --version) and returned version 8.8.5. I noticed Lars recommends version 8.10.2 (https://discordapp.com/channels/826816523368005654/826836848520200233/829303281184145468). 
Is there a ubuntu repository for haskell-platform that includes this newer version? Or will have to install the package elements separately from source?

### Install Nix

https://nixos.org/download.html

The quickest way to install Nix is to open a terminal and run the following command (as a user other than root with sudo permission):

$ sudo curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install | sh

Make sure to follow the instructions output by the script.

The installation script requires that you have sudo access to root.
